                        <p> I would say I am a fairly interesting person. Most people have described me as fun which I wholeheartedly agree.
                            I love going on all kinds of adventures, whether it be going grocery shopping or dancing in the moonlight.<p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Family</h2>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/myfamily.jpeg" alt="Rachel's Family" /></a>
                        <p> I really love my family, they are so fun to be around! There are 9 of us total: Dad, Mom, Sam, me, Jared, Nate, Timmy, Marc, and Anna.
                            The boys definitely outweigh the girls, but I would not have it any other way. My friends are always amazed when finding out how many siblings I have.
                            And honestly, I think it is really funny. </p>
                        <p>
                            My sister, Anna, is literally my pride and joy. I was the only girl for the longest time. I think I prayed every night for a sister until she came.
                            Her and I are 13 1/2 years apart, which is a pretty big age gap! It is so fun having a little sister, she makes me so happy.
                            However, it is pretty hard sometimes. For example, every time I come visit her, she has gotten so much older. I remember moving out 
                            and then seeing her only a couple months later, but she had learned to spell her own name when I was gone!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I love my family with all my heart and soul. They bring me so much joy.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Me</h2>
                        <a><<img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/rachel.png" alt="Rachel Bennion"</a>
                        <p> One of the things I do best is playing the guitar. I have been playing the acoustic for almost 8 years now.
                            People always ask me what kind of music I play, but to be honest, I do not have one specific genre. Growing up, my dad
                            introduced me to all kinds of music and it has stuck. I love listening to Weezer and Taylor Swift alike.</p>
                        <p> 
                            I also love to dance. I danced with the Southwest Dance Company for 11 years, and oh, how I miss it! Those were some of the best years I have experienced.
                            Through dancing, I found my love of performancing. I am hoping someday soon I can enter a stage again.
